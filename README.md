# Conversational AI with PyTorch

## Introduction
This project lays the foundation for anyone interested in the field of chatbots and conversational AI. Utilizing PyTorch, it demystifies the process of developing a chatbot that can understand and respond in contextually relevant ways.

## Architecture
At its core, the chatbot employs a neural network with two hidden layers, designed for simplicity yet capable of processing complex patterns. This structure proves that effective conversational models can be both accessible and powerful.

## Customization
Flexibility is key. By modifying `intents.json`, users can easily tailor the chatbot to suit a wide range of scenarios, from customer service to personal assistants. This file dictates the patterns the chatbot recognizes and its corresponding responses, allowing for endless possibilities.
